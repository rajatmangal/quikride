## Basic Idea:
Canada is currently lagging in carpooling technologies and this application attempts to rectify that. This app provides a flexible way to request and share rides anywhere within the region. Public transit in the region can be finicky, we all remember the transit strike that recently happened. This app provides a way for people to connect and share car rides, by either booking a car or advertising that their own car is available to pick up passengers. Our app is flexible for any userâ€™s car booking needs, from solo to group booking, and last-minute trips to booking rides ahead of time.
